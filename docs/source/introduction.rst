Introduction
============

Image Harvest (ih) is an open-source `Python <https://www.python.org/>`_ library for processing and analyzing plant images.
The software uses `OpenCV <http://opencv.org/>`_ for image processing, and `SciPy <http://www.scipy.org/>`_ for statistics.  
Besides inclusion of stand-alone scripts to access processing and statistics functions, ih is integrated with 
`Pegasus <pegasus.isi.edu>`_ to create and submit workflows to super computers.

Many software tools already exist to perform image analysis.  The ability to create distributed computing workflows
is one of the features that makes ih distinct.  Workflow generation is completely adaptable to any input, and can
be customized using many different modular processing components.

Image Harvest is a work in a progress.  For any help, questions, or bugs, please contact: avi@kurtknecht.com
