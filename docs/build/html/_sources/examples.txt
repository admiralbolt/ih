Examples
========
Working through examples is a much better way of learning how to use ih than
reading implementation details.  Additionally, creating workflows is a complicated
multi-step process.  As such, many examples are detailed below, falling into
two broad categories.  Script examples are those that deal with local computing.
Each script example includes a test image to download, as well as scripts
for library and command-line usage of ih.  Workflow examples are those that
deal with distributed computing.  They include template files for download,
but due to their nature, image sets are not available for download.
However, data sets are available through the OSG (Open Science Grid).  Workflow examples
are very complex.  Step by step instructions are provided, but it is **highly** recommended
to work through script examples before jumping into workflow examples.


Script Examples
---------------
There are many different script examples.  Some are specific to functions,
others cover a broad range of functions.  If you are getting started,
begin by working through the core processing examples.  In particular,
if you are unfamiliar with Python, the first core processing script attempts
to explain some basic terms.
